# Student Name: Milan Kumar Khadka (ICT Robotics)
## Linux Account Setup

First, I created a Microsoft Azure account using our university email address. Once my account was successfully set up, I received $100 in credit, which helped me acquire various tools and resources for learning.

## Create Virtual Machine

Next, I set up a virtual machine to use for learning and projects related to this course. I named the machine "lab-robotics," selected the option for no infrastructure redundancy, and chose the Trusted Launch Virtual Machines security type. I opted for Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 server with the B series, version 2, specifically Standard_B21s_v2. After completing all the setup steps, I obtained a key and selected the "Connect" option, choosing the native SSH option.
There was a button to copy and execute the SSH command. I copied the key and pasted it into Windows PowerShell, using the generated link to access the Linux virtual machine. This allows us to use Linux on a Windows laptop without installing it.

## Linking my GitHub account to my HAMK email

For the assignment, I created a new repository named "Linux." I also linked my HAMK email as a secondary email for version control.

Some of screenshots while doing the task are as follows:
